Building an image generator with a persistent gallery is a great way to showcase the full power of the Firebase ecosystem paired with Google's generative models.
Here is a comprehensive README.md for your AI Image Generator & Gallery.
🎨 DreamGallery: AI Image Generator
DreamGallery is a full-stack application that transforms text prompts into high-fidelity visual art using Google AI (Imagen/Gemini) and stores them in a community-driven gallery powered by Firebase.

🔥 Key Features
 * Text-to-Image Generation: Powered by Google’s latest generative models via the Firebase AI Logic SDK.
 * Persistent Gallery: Automatically saves every generated masterpiece to a global or user-specific feed.
 * Seamless Storage: High-resolution images are hosted on Firebase Storage with optimized delivery.
 * Real-time Updates: The gallery syncs instantly across all devices using Cloud Firestore snapshots.
 * Smart Metadata: Each image is tagged with the original prompt and generation settings (aspect ratio, style).
 * Download & Share: One-click downloads for generated assets.
🛠️ Tech Stack
 * Frontend: Vite + React (or your chosen framework)
 * AI Engine: Google AI / Imagen 3 via Firebase AI Logic
 * Backend: Firebase Studio
   * Authentication: Secure user sign-in.
   * Cloud Firestore: Database for image metadata and prompt history.
   * Cloud Storage: Reliable hosting for the generated .png or .jpg files.
 * Styling: Tailwind CSS (for that modern, dark-mode aesthetic).
⚙️ How It Works
 * The Prompt: User enters a descriptive prompt (e.g., "A neon-lit cyberpunk cat in a rainy Tokyo street").
 * The Magic: The frontend calls the generateImages() method from the Firebase AI Logic SDK.
 * The Storage: The resulting image data is converted to a blob and uploaded to a dedicated folder in Firebase Storage.
 * The Record: A new document is added to the images collection in Firestore, containing the Storage URL and the prompt.
 * The Gallery: The UI listens to Firestore changes and updates the masonry grid in real-time.
